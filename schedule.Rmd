<hr>

My office is 228 Walker Hall. I am usually on campus Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Students enrolled in my classes should use their private forums on AsULearn to contact me electronically when needed. I will not answer direct email from current students. Changes to this schedule will be announced to students via Course Announcements on AsULearn.

The number of office hours offered in a given semester is a function of the credit hours of standard classes a professor is teaching. You can book Office Hour appointments in 15-minute increments [HERE](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UU0zQUk4blgtNW44fGRlZmF1bHR8Y2EyZDZmYTMxNmZjMWEwMjdiMzE0ZjQ1MmEwNDFjMmE). If you feel like you will need more than 15 minutes, book more than one slot. Drop-ins are also welcome, but scheduled appointments will take priority.
