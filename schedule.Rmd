My office is located in 228 Walker Hall. Students enrolled in my classes should use their private forums on AsULearn to contact me electronically when needed. I will not answer direct email from currently enrolled students.

Before-class office hours are in Dr. Thomley's office. After-class office hours are in the computer lab. You are welcome to come to the lab hours to work on class assignments, even if you do not have a specific question. Wednesday 3pm office hours on JAN 23, FEB 20, MAR 13, and APR 10 may be moved due to department meetings. Changes will be announced to students via Course Announcements on AsULearn.
